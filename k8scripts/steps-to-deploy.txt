1. Create a deployment script by name "hellorest-dep.yml".  The name of the deployment script can be anything.

2. Now you can create the deployment using the script as below 
	kubectl create -f hellorest-dep.yml

3. Assuming, you got no errors, you can verify if your deployment
   is created with the below command 
	kubectl get deployments

4. Now check if the pods pertaining to your deployment is created 
	kubectl get pods
5. In order to access your microservice, expose them as a service 
kubectl expose deployment hello-rest-dep --type=NodePort --port=8080
6. To find the node ips you can use the below command 
	kubectl get nodes -o wide
7. Now we need to find the nodeport alloted by K8 for our service
	kubectl get services
8. From browser, you can now test if your service is accessible at    the url
	http://10.192.0.2:31614
	http://10.192.0.3:31614
	http://10.192.0.4:31614

   In the above URL port 31614 is the NodePort where the service
   is exposed
